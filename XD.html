<b>WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION</b>
<hr>
<p>Please be advised that my first webpage only contains HTML codes.</p>
<p>I am learning <br>more and more every day that will make my webpage more affective.</p>
<p>Soon i will be able to actually add color, graphics, and formatting features that make this page look good.</p>
<p>Learning <br>to write HTML code is the first step in creating web pages.</p>
<p>I know I will be learning <br>each day I am in class.</p>
<p>I know that I must be patient with others while i am learning <br>web page design.</p>
